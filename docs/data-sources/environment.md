### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the environment. Must be a URL-friendly string according to RFC 3968.
- `type` (String) The type of the environment. Unleash recognizes 'development', 'test', 'preproduction' and 'production'. You can pass other values and Unleash will accept them but they will carry no special semantics.

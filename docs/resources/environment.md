## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the environment. Must be a URL-friendly string according to RFC 3968. Changing this property will require the resource to be replaced, it's generally safer to remove this resource and create a new one.
- `type` (String) The type of the environment. Unleash recognizes 'development', 'test', 'preproduction' and 'production'. You can pass other values and Unleash will accept them but they will carry no special semantics.

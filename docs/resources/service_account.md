# unleash_service_account (Resource)

Service accounts do nothing on their own, they need service account tokens to be created to do anything useful.
		All tokens bound to a service account will take on the permissions of the root role assigned to the service account. It's strongly
		recommended to use the unleash_role data source to retrieve one of the built in roles and use the id from that to set the service account
		role id.

		See the [Unleash documentation](https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/service-accounts) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "unleash_role" "admin_role" {
  name = "Admin"
}

resource "unleash_service_account" "admin service account" {
  name      = "something unique"
  username  = "something unique"
  root_role = admin_role.id
}
```
